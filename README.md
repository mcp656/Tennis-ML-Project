# Tennis ML Project
This project aims to predict the outcomes of tennis matches using machine learning techniques. The dataset are downloaded from Jeff Sackmann's Tennis Database, which contains historical match data, player statistics, and other relevant information. Furthermore, odds data from XYZ are used to estimate the potential profitability of betting strategies based on the model's predictions.
