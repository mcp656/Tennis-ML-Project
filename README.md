# Tennis ML Project
This project aims to predict the outcomes of tennis matches using machine learning techniques. The dataset are downloaded from Jeff Sackmann's Tennis Database, which contains historical match data, player statistics, and other relevant information.

Currently I am working on making features based on playing surface. 

Personal for fun project!
